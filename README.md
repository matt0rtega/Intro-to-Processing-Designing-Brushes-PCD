# Intro to Processing: Designing Brushes - Processing Community Day Edition

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. The goal of the class will be to learn how to create custom brushes, designing first on paper, and thinking about the set of rules that can help us achieve our design. Over the coarse of the class we will also explore topics such as randomness, movement, scenes, and interface design with control p5. We will be looking to finish a complete sketch that can be used as the start of a new project, a finished piece, or an element of a future performance.

## **Introduction and What I Do**

**What is the overall project for the day?** Designing your Own Brushes & Drawing Program

**Why learn to code and build your own tools?**

- As technology enters more and more into our lives, we need to become technologically literate and be able to define the usage of new technologies
- When technologies are created, they are very impressionable, and often the early usage may define its' usage in the future

**We comply with someone elses thinking**

- This might be okay sometimes, but other times you want the tool to comply with your own thinking, or maybe you want it to solve a problem that other tools out there do not solve
- The choice of using someone else tool, versus your own, becomes part of the artistic decision making process
- You assess what you are looking to achieve, and decide what is the correct path
    - Quick Ideas, Pencil and Paper
    - On the go painting, iPad with apple pencil
    - Algorithmic & generative forms, programming
- Designing the tool is really working at the most granular level of art making, which is starting with the material itself

**How to approach learning to code?** - I found it easier to learn how to code when it was through something that I was interested. Alot of the current approaches out there just try to teach you generalized coding, but without an overall project in mind application, it quickly gets to what the hell I am using this for.

## **Requirements:**

- Processing - Processing.org
- Colorpicking Tool
- A few sample images
- Pencil & Notebook

---

## **Build 1 - IDE, Shapes and Colors**

- What is the difference between Processing and other software?
    - Basically processing is a library packaged into an IDE (Integrated development environment), this thing
- It gives artists an easier way to learn how to code and to get to your creative practice faster, so compared to having to build a circle from nothing everytime, which after using other languages I realize you sometimes have to do. It gives us some easy to use items.
- Here we are looking at a few basic shapes that we can begin working with to:
    - Line
    - Rect
    - Ellipse
    - Point
    - Image Texture

## **Build 1 - Variables & Functions**

- Storing information
- Organization & Complex actions
- Arguments

## **Build 02 - Reference, Built-in Variables, Conditions, Loops, and Random Numbers**
